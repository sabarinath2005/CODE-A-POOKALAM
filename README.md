# 🌸 TinkerHub SBCE – Code-a-Pookkalam 🌸

Pookkalam is a timeless tradition of Onam — colorful floral patterns that bring people together in creativity and joy.
But this time, we’re mixing tradition with tech. Instead of petals, we’re using pixels. Instead of flowers, we’re using code.

Welcome to **Code-a-Pookkalam**, where art meets HTML & CSS! 🎨💻

Project description:Project Overview: Code-a-Pookalam (Onam – Kerala)

Code-a-Pookalam is an imaginative and festive coding initiative—an artistic celebration of Onam, Kerala’s colorful harvest festival—reimagined in the digital realm using HTML and CSS.

. Art Meets Code: Instead of using traditional flower petals, this project invites participants to craft Pookalam (the floral rangoli of Onam) through creative CSS   and HTML patterns—think geometric shapes, gradients, and animations—without relying on images or external frameworks. 

. Celebrate Tradition, Learn Modern Skills: The project's tagline sums it up beautifully: "Pookkalam is a timeless tradition of Onam—colorful floral patterns that    bring people together in creativity and joy. But this time, we’re mixing tradition with tech."
